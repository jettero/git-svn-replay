        <p> I needed a tool that would let me stuff several git repos into one svn repo so I could
        browse the source from five logically independant projects in one logically unified
        <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> wiki.</p>

        <p>This project will replay a git repo into svn and will automatically keep track of which
        commits have been replayed and not.  It uses mainly native svn and git commands to do this
        (so both must be installed).  It carefully preserves the dates and commit log entries into
        svn (again, using native svn commands to do so).</p>

        <p>It is written (mostly) in perl using many modules from CPAN.</p>

        <p> I wrote this for a specific need.  I didn't even do a particularly good job, but it
        definitely functions.  I'm sure there are many uses for such a project, particularly if it
        were done with more care and was a more complete solution.  If you have ideas for this
        project or would like to take it over and make something really spectactular, then please
        <a href="/ask_paul.xml">contact me</a> about it. </p>
