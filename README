GIT REPLAY

The git replay machine uses DBM::Deep to keep from replaying commits that have
already found their way into the svn repo.  So far, the git_replay machine
doesn't handle branching at all.  Well, ... it'll replay the branches, but the
deltas may not make completely make sense to svn...

./git_replay git+ssh://hostname/path/whatever

SVN BUILDER

The git_replay tool can be used with any checked out svn directory.  You don't
need to use the svn_builder script at all!  Simply point the git_replay package
to a checked-out svn directory and let it do it's thing.

If you do not use svn_builder, you'll need to add a pre-revprop-change hook
that allows svn:date property changes -- that's more trivial than it sounds.

If you're like me though, you don't really know how to operate svn.

To start a new svn mirror-repo:

    ./svn_builder /path/to/svn/repo/ /path/to/checked/out/svn/ [dir1] [dir2] [ ... dirN]

    (You can optionally add directories in the svn to dump your git stuff into.)

To add another directory to the svn repo:

    ./svn_builder /path/to/svn/repo/ /path/to/checked/out/svn/ dir1 [dir2] [ ... dirN]

    (This is really just mkdir dir1, svn add dir1, and svn commit -m "something" ...)
