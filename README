DISCLAIMER

It's maybe 100% certain that there's bugs in this strange thing.

Please make backups of all your svn and git repositories before you try to use
this for anything.  Also, please do not blame me if it ruins your repos.  I
warned you to make backups.



GIT REPLAY

The git replay machine uses DBM::Deep to keep from replaying commits that have
already found their way into the svn repo.

./git_svn_replay git_project7_url /path/to/checked.out.svn/project7

The subdir under the checked out svn is optional.



SVN BUILDER

The git_svn_replay tool can be used with any checked out svn directory.  You
don't need to use the svn_builder script at all!  Simply point the
git_svn_replay package to a checked-out svn directory and let it do it's thing.

If you do not use svn_builder, you'll need to add a pre-revprop-change hook
that allows svn:date property changes -- that's more trivial than it sounds.

If you're like me though, you don't really know how to operate svn.

To start a new svn mirror-repo:

    ./svn_builder /path/to/svn/repo/ /path/to/checked/out/svn/ [dir1] [dir2] [
... dirN]

    (You can optionally add directories in the svn to dump your git stuff into.)

To add another directory to the svn repo:

    ./svn_builder /path/to/svn/repo/ /path/to/checked/out/svn/ dir1 [dir2] [ ... dirN]

    (This is really just mkdir dir1, svn add dir1, and svn commit -m "something" ...)
