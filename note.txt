You must be very, very careful when changing svn:date. At the moment,
SVN assumes that commit dates increase monotonically with revision
numbers. So, while it's possible to change svn:date, braking this
assumption would mean that the -r{date} option would not work reliably
any more.

Yes, we have A Plan to remove this restriction in future.
